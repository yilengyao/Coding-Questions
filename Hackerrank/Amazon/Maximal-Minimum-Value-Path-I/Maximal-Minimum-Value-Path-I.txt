Maximal Minimum Value Path I
Given a two 2D integer array, find the max score of a path from the upper left cell to bottom right cell. The score of a path is the minimum value in that path.

Notice: the path can only right and down.

For example:

Input:

[7,5,3]
[2,0,9]
[4,5,9]

Here are some paths from [0,0] to [2,2] and the minimum value on each path:

path: 7->2->4->5->9, minimum value on this path: 2

path: 7->2->0->9->9, minimum value on this path: 0

path: 7->2->0->5->9, minimum value on this path: 0

In the end the max score(the min value) of all the paths is 3. 

Output: 3
