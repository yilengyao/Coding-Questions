Find Related Products

This question is based on the product recommendation system on Amazon. Every time you open the product page on Amazon you can see a section "People who viewed this also viewed". Now given a product relationship represented as a a graph(adjacent list), find out the largest connected component on this graph.

Notice the graph is transitive.

For example:

Input:
[["product1", "product2", "product3"]
["product5", "product2"]
["product6", "product7"]
["product18", "product7"]

Output:
["product1", "product2", "product3", "product5"]

Explanation:

Here product1 has 2 recommendations: "product2", "product3"
Product2 has 1 recommendation: "product5"

Put it together we have the largest recommendation component ["product1", "product2", "product3", "product5"]

Notice; ["product6", "product7", "product8"] is also a connected component but samaller thatn the previous one.
