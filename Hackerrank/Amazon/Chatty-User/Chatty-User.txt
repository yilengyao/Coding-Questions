Chatty User
A startup that builds a chat app wants to identify highly social users. All the chat data is in a large log file with three values on each line - the sender ID, receipient ID, and the number of messages. Given a threshold number, find the number of users that appear at least as many times as this threshold.

For example:
USERA USERB 14
USERA USERC 94
USERB USERB 3
...
Note: On the third line, a user sents a message to himself.

Inputs
logs = a list of lines where each line is a string
threshold = a number

Output
Return a list of sorted user IDs. If the same user appears in the same line, only count them once.

Example:
Input:
logs:
345366 899212 45
029323 382391 23
382391 345366 15
029323 382391 77
345366 382391 23
029323 345366 13
382391 382391 23
...
threshold: 3

Output: [029323, 345366, 382391]
