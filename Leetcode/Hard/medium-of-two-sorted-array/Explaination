Say we have 2 arrays a and b

We will do binary search of cutting away the median of either a or b.

Lets say we want to find the ordinal k of combined array a and b.

lets say a[a_mid] <= b[b_mid].

We know that the order of the combined array a1 <= a_mid <= b_mid <= b2.

if a_mid + b_mid < k.

We know that
a1 < a2 < a3 < a4 < a_mid < a6 < a7

b1 < b2 < b_mid

We know in the combined array, the worst case scenerio.

[ a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, b2 ] < a_mid 

let (a + b) denote the combined array

so the order of a_mid is less than k and (a + b)[k] > a[a_mid] and we can cut array elements in a that is left of a_mid.

With the same argument
if a_mid + b_mid >= k

we can argue that (a + b)[k] <= b[b_mid] and we can cut array elements in b that is right of b_mid.
